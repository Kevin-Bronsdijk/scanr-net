## Getting Started

First you need to sign up for the [ScanR](https://scanr.xyz/) and obtain your unique **API Token**. Once you have set up your account, you can start using ScanR.

## How to use

You can convert/can your documents by providing the URL of the document you want to  to text or upload the document directly instead. Just keep in mind that the document URL must be accessible for ScanR. 

## Authentication

The first step is to authenticate to ScanR API by providing your unique AAPI Token while creating a new connection.

```C#
 var connection = ScanRConnection.Create("token");
```

## Direct upload images

ScanR allows you to easily upload your images as can be seen within the example below:

**File path** (Byte array also supported)

```C#
var client = new ScanRClient(connection);

var response = await client.Scan(
		"document-location-on-disk.png",
                Language.English
                );

if (response.Success)
    var text = response.Body.Text
```

## Direct upload Pdfs

Pdfs can have multiple results which is based on the amount of pages included within the document. Therefore, the call returns a different result as shown within the examples below:

**File path** (Byte array also supported)

```C#
var client = new ScanRClient(connection);

var response = await client.ScanPdf(
		"document-location-on-disk.pdf",
                Language.English
                );

if (response.Success)
    var text = response.Body.Text // Array of items for each page
```

## Public Urls
If the resource is already available on the web, it's not necessary to upload the document. Just add the public URL as included within this sample. 

**Public Url for Images** 

```C#
var client = new ScanRClient(connection);

var response = await client.Scan(
		new Uri("http://blah.blah/image.png")
                Language.English
                );

if (response.Success)
    var text = response.Body.Text
```

**Public Url for Pdfs** 

```C#
var client = new ScanRClient(connection);

var response = await client.ScanPdf(
		new Uri("http://blah.blah/image.pdf")
                Language.English
                );

if (response.Success)
    var text = response.Body.Text // Array of items for each page
```
